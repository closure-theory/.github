# Closure Theory

**Closure Theory** is a structural framework for classical gravity and ontology.  
It studies what kinds of structure are *admissible in principle* once a system is required to close on itself under conservation, covariance, and symmetry exhaustion.

The framework is classificatory, not phenomenological. It determines *what must be true* if a system is closed—rather than proposing new dynamics, new substances, or data fits.

## Core Idea

A system is **closed** if:

- it admits a **finite conserved quadratic norm**;
- all bookkeeping is **internal** (no hidden reservoirs, no compensating divergences);
- admissibility is **sectorwise** and **covariant**;
- symmetry reduction **exhausts functional freedom**, leaving only **intrinsic degrees of freedom (DOF)**.

Once closure is imposed, the number and type of admissible DOF are no longer arbitrary. They are fixed by structure.

## What This Framework Does *Not* Do

Closure Theory:

- does **not** introduce new particles, forces, or phenomenological laws;
- does **not** fit observational data or target anomalies;
- does **not** postulate independent dark sectors;
- does **not** assume a specific action or field equation;
- does **not** reduce mind to matter or matter to mind.

It operates *prior* to model-building: at the level of admissibility and classification.

## What It Does Do (Physics)

Within closed classical gravity, Closure Theory establishes regime-level classification and rigidity results showing that:

- isolated vacuum exteriors are rigid and unique;
- extended disc systems admit exactly **one** redistributive intrinsic DOF;
- homogeneous–isotropic cosmology admits exactly **one** residual extensive intrinsic DOF;
- inverse-square, inverse-linear, and inverse-cube scalings are regime-level necessities;
- independent dark matter and dark energy sectors are structurally inadmissible;
- gravitational coupling must be universal;
- exactly **three** symmetry-exhausted gravitational regimes exist in three spatial dimensions.

These are **theorems**, not interpretations.

## Degrees of Freedom: The Unifying Structural Primitive

The key object in Closure Theory is the **intrinsic degree of freedom**.

An intrinsic DOF is:

- a **conserved modulus** that survives symmetry reduction;
- **not** eliminable by gauge or coordinate choice;
- **not** mere functional variation from symmetry-breaking;
- **not** tunable without breaking closure.

When closure and symmetry exhaustion hold, the intrinsic DOF count is fixed.

This logic is **domain-independent**.

## Ontology: Why Reality Cannot Have Arbitrary Structure

At the ontological level, Closure Theory implies:

- reality cannot be an unconstrained collection of independent primitives;
- any self-consistent ontology must close under its own explanatory bookkeeping;
- closure forbids:
  - infinite explanatory regress,
  - independent ontological “sectors” that do not reduce,
  - ad hoc additions introducing new intrinsic DOF.

An ontology with arbitrarily many independent primitives is structurally inadmissible for the same reason a gravity theory with arbitrarily many free parameters is inadmissible.

**Being itself must be low-DOF.**

## Mind and Consciousness: Structural (Not Reductive)

The framework constrains theories of mind without reducing mind to matter (or vice versa).

**What is claimed (structural):**
- A unified, coherent mind is a **closed system** in the same bookkeeping sense:
  - it preserves internal invariants (identity/continuity),
  - it admits transformation without fragmentation,
  - it avoids parallel, non-reducing explanatory sectors.

**Analogy to gravity (structural correspondence):**
- Closure-based systems naturally separate into:
  - a **constraint / stabilising** aspect (continuity, identity, invariance),
  - a **redistributive / integrative** aspect (reconfiguration, integration, novelty),
  with admissibility requiring sectorwise finiteness and no tuned cancellations.

**What is not claimed:**
- no specific neural mechanism is asserted;
- no position is taken on panpsychism vs physicalism;
- no claims are made about qualia types or computational substrates.

Closure Theory constrains **what theories of mind are admissible**, not which one is “true”.

## Logical Status

All results are **conditional**.

They apply if a system is:
- classical (in the relevant regime sense),
- covariant,
- closed,
- symmetry-exhausted.

Rejecting any premise exits the framework rather than refuting a theorem.
